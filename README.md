- Please note that this is an alpha version

This is my PocketStar Emulator. Sorry, but no Source code release,yet. But you can download the newes compiled version here: https://github.com/Schuemi/PocketStarEmu/releases

You need Windows10 64bit and a fast computer to run.

# How to start?

pocketstaremu.exe [filename] [-cycles] [-scaleX]

filename 

  The filename has to be a PocketStar Game (compiled as Build type "game"),  "pocketris.bin" for example.
  
-cycles

  This means that the emulator executes the real CPU cycles. Your computer must be very fast to accurately replicate the cycles. Something about an Intel i7 with 3.2 GHz, I think. If your computer isn't fast enough, but you need the right number of cycles during an emulated second, please use it. 
  
 -scaleX
 
  The window size. you can use -scale2 to -scale8. (Without a space between -scale and the number)
  
  # The controls
  UP = arrow up
  
  LEFT = arrow left
  
  DOWN = arrow down
  
  RIGHT = arrow right
  
  A = space
  
  B = left strg
  
  Pause = ESC
  
  
  
  # What is missing?
  - no vibration yet,
  - no SD-Card support
  - some CPU instructions are missing (but not used somewhere, yet)
  - many SAMD21 components (also not used in a game, yet)
  - some display commands
  - no brightness
  - the display colors are not quite right yet
